### English Helper Response:
That's great! I can help you learn English. To start, what are you most interested in learning? For example, are you interested in:

*   **Basic conversation?** (Like how to introduce yourself and ask simple questions)
*   **Grammar?** (Like understanding sentence structure)
*   **Vocabulary?** (Learning new words)
*   **Reading and writing?**
*   **Something else?**

Tell me what you'd like to learn, and we can begin! Also, what is your native language? Knowing this will help me explain things more clearly. ðŸ˜Š
